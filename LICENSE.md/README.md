This code simulates the opposing effects of reactivation of sensory patterns on memory and was used to generate the figures 
shown in Staudigl &amp; Hanslmayr "Reactivation of neural patterns during memory reinstatement supports encoding specificity" 
submitted to Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.
